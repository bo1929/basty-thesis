% Retell what you have done.
Ethology, the scientific study of animal behavior, focuses on behavior under natural conditions and is a rapidly growing field.
With its scientific roots in the late 19th and 20th centuries, it became a well-recognized scientific discipline and yielded significant insight into general principles of the nervous system.
Behavior, as arguably the most robust output of the brain, is needed to be deciphered to understand complex neurobiological phenomena, including sleep.
Technical advances, ranging from imaging technologies to machine learning techniques, transformed ethology into a new computational discipline, and the field of computational ethology has emerged.

In the past decade, remarkable tools, which involve computer vision and machine learning, have been developed for automated quantification of animal behavior.
Employing such tools provided unprecedented insight into complex behaviors, such as hunting and mating \citep{mearns_deconstructing_2020, janisch_deciphering_2021}.
Yet still, challenges remain open.
While behaviors exhibited by awake animals tend to be characterized by major postural and positional changes, the behavioral repertoire of asleep animals includes subtle movements and unobtrusive changes that sparsely occur during long sleep cycles.
Thus, exploring and quantifying the behavioral repertoire of sleep requires special care and additional considerations.

To this end, we developed
