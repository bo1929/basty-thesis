% Öznur Taştan
I honestly couldn't ask for a better advisor than Öznur Taştan.
Being Öznur's student and working closely with her was a privilege.
I am grateful for her precious guidance, generous support, and sincerity.
Öznur's impact is immeasurable and it is a blessing to have an exceptional advisor like her.
Thank you Öznur for believing in me.

% Sündüz Keleş
I would like to express reverence and my gratitude to my co-advisor, Sündüz Keleş, for being an excellent role model and an incredible mentor.
I will be forever indebted to Sündüz, whose enthusiasm and determinism have always been motivating, and who has inspired me beyond my career and education.
Thank you Sündüz for encouraging me.

% Mehmet Fatih Keleş

I would like to thank Gözde Bozdağı Akar, Ercüment Çiçek, and Onur Varol for the time they spent while serving on my committee.
Their invaluable feedback and critical evaluations have improved the quality and the readability of this work.

% Enes Recep Türkoğlu
% Thanks to my dear friend and roommate Enes R. Türkoğlu for being a constant but fun source of procrastination.
% It has been seven good years; time does not pass, it continues.

% Family
I couldn't have achieved anything without my family.
I cannot express how grateful I am for having the most supporting and lovely parents and sister.
They have raised me as an individual who aims to contribute to greater things and who does not give up easily.
My father, Recai, was there for me in both good times and bad times.
He worked very hard to make sure that I had the best education possible.
The continuous and unconditional love of my mother, Fatma Hanım, has supported me at every stage of my life, and helped me to ``stay in line''.
My little sister, Elif Nehir, has always cheered me up and her existence itself is a source of peace and joy.
